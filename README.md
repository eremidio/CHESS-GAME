# CHESS-GAME
A SIMPLE CHESS GAME DONE IN C++.  A PROTOTYPE OF THE GAME DONE IN PYTHON IS ALSO AVAILABLE.

IN THE PRESENT STATE THERE ARE NO MORE ERRORS IN THE CHESS LOGIC OF THE GAME. THE GAME CAN BE PLAYED  BY TWO USERS IN THE SAME COMPUTER USING THE LINUX OR WINDOWS POWERSHELL TERMINAL (MAYBE SOME ESCAPE SEQUENCES MAY NOT WORK WELL IN WINDOWS, BUT THAT'S EASILY CORRECTED). FUTHER STEPS WILL CONSIST IN MAKE A GUI INTERFACE FOR THE GAME AND PROGRAM A CHESS ENGINE. 


ANY HELP FOR IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE ENTIRELY WELLCOME.
